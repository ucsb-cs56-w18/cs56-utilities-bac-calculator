(a)  A calculator that is used to measure the BAC. Takes in weight, hours
     drinking, gender, and number of drinks. In addition, it outputs if
     the user is safe to drive and how long it would take for them to be
     legaly able to drive.

(b) **As a user, I can enter the amount of beers I've had so that the
     calculator can calculate my BAC.
     **As a user, I can read relate to some symptoms listed on the text field.
     **As a user, I can view the amount of hours until I am able to legally
     drive again.
(c)  The sofware runs!
(d)  As a user, I can enter the amount of hours since I last consumed alcohol.
     As a user, I can undergo visual tests to further judge my BAC.
(e)  The current README.md doesn't fully list all the outputs the user can see.
     We can fully explain all the outputs.
     We can also list all of the inputs the program takes in.
(f)  All targets have description. There is no old legacy JWS.
(g)  Yes, we can earn 1175 points.
(h)  Not applicable.
(i)  The source files are stored poorly. Needs more organization. Source code
     files are stored under 5 subdirectories.
     Code looks clean and separated by class.
(j)  There are test cases for every method, but there is still room for more
     tests. For example, we can add a test for gender.
